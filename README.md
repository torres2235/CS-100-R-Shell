### Introduction

This is a command shell, called rshell, developed in C++. In this rshell, the user will be prompted with "$" for input. The user is able to see directories using "ls". It will have connectors "&&", "||", and ";" that function as they should in a regular shell. The user is able to print out what they have typed using the "echo" input. Comments are avaliable by using "#". The user will be able to exit the rshell by inputing "exit"
